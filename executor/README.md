### Hosting Your Model Guide
This guide helps you after you've started the agent, which is usually hosted on `127.0.0.1:9000` by default. Once you're connected, you can start hosting your own model on the agent.

First, you need to prepare the model you want to use. Right now, we don't have a simple interface to set up models, but we're planning to add one in the future. For now, if you're comfortable with Python code, you can follow our examples to easily host your models.

If you don't have the hardware to host a small model, you can connect to Gemini Pro or ChatGPT using the API token. We're currently working on more tutorials to make this process easier for everyone.
