# Contributing Guidelines

Kuwa is an open-source community, welcome everyone to participate in contributing 😁

## Where can I start contributing?

Currently, Kuwa GenAI OS is still in a very early stage, you can first refer to our [installation guide](./README.md#Getting%20Started) to try to install the whole system. If you encounter any problems during the process, that's great 👍 it means our document is not clear enough. If you encounter any problems, please feel free to inform us through [our community](./community.md), we will try our best to help you solve any difficulties.

If you think any feature is cool, welcome to issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/kuwaai/genai-os/issues), or contact us through [our community](./community.md), we are happy to discuss any cool ideas with you.
Of course, if you do some features yourself and want to merge them into Kuwa GenAI OS, you are also welcome to submit Pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/kuwaai/genai-os/pulls), thank you for your contribution. 🎉
